# Realtime text editor

For this app, i use [Quill.js](http://quilljs.com/)

I just have a div container for text editor in `homepage.ejs`

I have Quill dependencie in `assets/dependencies` folder

After that is create an `Editor` controller to send to co-worker each text modification

And in my `assets/mains.js` simple code to send and receive modifications.

Realy easy !
